# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:
JSX is a javascript markdown syntax extension that works similar like HTML. JSX is a building block of REACT components and what allows React to create user interfaces. It looks like a combination of JavaScript and an extended set of HTML.

Researched answer:
JSX is a React extension to Javascript. It allows JavaScript and HTML to co-exist. This allows component rendering using syntax similar to HTML.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: 
A react app is made of thousands of code snippets called node modules, that has to be organized in a certain way. So in order to create a new React app we have to download a package containing these modules. Yarn (yet another resource negotiator) is the command that will download these modules and create a file structure for a React app. 

Researched answer:
YARN is a package that contains node modules , it allows the use and share of code with developers around the world. The code is shared through a package and includes j.son file which describes the package. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer:
Anonymous function is a function that does not have a name. 

Researched answer:
An anonymous function is a function that is not bound to an identifier. For example function() is a function that is missing its name, an anonymous function. 

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer:
An object is a data type that contains data like names, keys values etc. A class is a template from which objects are created, it is a holder for what the object is going to look like. Similar to a blueprint and a house, house being the object. 

Researched answer:
A class is a blueprint, it defines the different properties that an object can have, but it doesn't give it any data or information. An object is a specific version of a class that has its information filled.

5. What is the difference between state and props in React?

Span is a inline container , typically used for spanning text and use ot for styling. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Also known as OOP is a class based programming based on "objects" which contains data and code and can be accessed and modified. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is a scripting language, object oriented with syntax that makes it feel like coding in English language. 

3. Implicit return: Ruby has implicit returns which means there is no need for the return key because it already returns the lst expression in path of the execution. 

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby Blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. 

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hash is a collection of key value pairs and each key is associated with a value.
